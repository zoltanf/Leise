# Release Checklist

## Before the Stable Tag

- `xcodebuild test -project TypeWhisper.xcodeproj -scheme TypeWhisper -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -parallel-testing-enabled NO CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY='-' CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- `swift test --package-path TypeWhisperPluginSDK`
- `xcodebuild -project TypeWhisper.xcodeproj -scheme TypeWhisper -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build -destination 'generic/platform=macOS' CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY='-' CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- `bash scripts/check_first_party_warnings.sh build.log`
- Review `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `docs/support-matrix.md`, `docs/release-readiness.md`, `TypeWhisperPluginSDK/Plugins/README.md`, and `TypeWhisperPluginSDK/README.md`
- If README screenshots changed, run `scripts/update-readme-screenshots.sh`; otherwise verify the gallery with `scripts/update-readme-screenshots.sh --check`
- Confirm marketplace plugin manifests and registry releases carry the current `sdkCompatibilityVersion`
- Confirm `MARKETING_VERSION = 1.6.0` across the app, CLI, and widgets
- Prepare or refresh `docs/release-notes/1.6.0.md`
- If you want to edit the notes directly on GitHub, create or update the draft release for `v1.6.0` before pushing the tag
- Otherwise the release workflow will publish `docs/release-notes/1.6.0.md` automatically when no release already exists

## Before `1.6.0-rc1`

- Confirm `1.3.x` builds continue to use `plugins-v1.json`
- Confirm `1.4.x`, `1.5.x`, `1.6.0-rc*`, `1.6.0` daily, and `1.6.0` stable builds use `plugins-community-v1.json`
- Confirm community registry entries under `PluginRegistry/community-v1/` set `source` to `community`; omitted `source` values in published feeds must remain official marketplace entries
- Keep community plugin submissions out of the `1.6` release scope unless they are already bundled or first-party
- Smoke-test the Integrations hub grouped lists for Built-in, Marketplace, Community, and Manual plugin paths
- Smoke-test the Installed, Discover, and Manual tabs at desktop and compact window sizes
- Verify Discover search, the Community include/exclude checkbox, and the capability filter menu
- Verify source, hosting, and multi-capability badges and filters for Local, Cloud, Transcription, LLM, Action, Memory, and combined-capability plugins
- Verify manual `.bundle` installation, external bundle enable/disable, and incompatible bundle notices
- Verify plugin update discovery still works for official and community registry entries
- Verify Plugin SDK workflow snapshots expose names, triggers, behavior settings, output routing, and Local/Cloud-safe metadata without exposing SwiftData objects

## RC Smoke Checks

- Publish `1.6.0-rc*` on the `release-candidate` channel and daily builds on the `daily` channel
- Stable builds must use only the default channel
- Fresh install
- Permission recovery
- First dictation
- File transcription
- Workflow prompt action
- Global LLM fallback list: add provider/model pairs, reject duplicates, reorder entries, remove entries, and preserve unavailable providers for repair
- Inherited prompt/workflow LLM processing: verify unavailable, restore, rate-limit, network/API, and empty-result failures advance to the next entry; explicit workflow providers remain strict single calls; cancellation and total failure insert no text
- Workflow setup step (cross-tab navigation)
- History edit/export
- Post-processing transparency in history and indicators
- Workflow matching for app + URL, URL-only, app-only, direct hotkey, and fallback triggers
- Global fallback workflow when no app- or URL-specific workflow matches
- Notch, Overlay, and Minimal indicator styles
- Transcript preview toggle for Notch and Overlay
- Plugin enable/disable
- Local model plugin settings: save and remove HuggingFace token, then verify download error copy for Qwen3, Granite, Voxtral, and Supertonic
- Supertonic plugin: verify OpenRAIL-M license checkbox gates the first model download and that changed license revision requires re-acceptance
- Gemma 4 plugin: verify E2B/E4B 4-bit download and load, and verify E4B 8-bit plus 26B-A4B remain visible but disabled with explanatory copy
- Community term pack download and apply
- Built-in term packs render localized metadata in English and German
- App audio recording with separate tracks
- System Audio Recorder settings: verify final transcript creation and live transcript preview are separate toggles, and recorder engine/model controls remain visible when live preview is off
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text plugin
- Sound feedback settings (enable, disable, and custom sounds)
- Non-blocking model download
- Dictionary JSON export and import
- Dictionary terms are forwarded to streaming providers (AssemblyAI, Soniox, SpeechAnalyzer) without breaking the session
- Parakeet V2/V3 model version selection
- Very short speech clips with and without actual speech
- Streaming preview versus the no-speech guard
- Media pause during recording (play music, start recording, verify pause, stop recording, verify resume)
- Mouse button shortcut (configure and trigger dictation)
- Remapped Hyperkey shortcut (record, stop, and prompt palette paths)
- Fn hotkey in both press-and-release and press-and-hold strategies
- Audio preview and recording after input-device changes, especially AirPods and Bluetooth profile switches
- Audio recovery after Bluetooth route changes (verify no crash)
- Auto-submit workflow behavior
- Disable history saving (toggle off, dictate, verify no entry created)
- STT and AI-processed text both shown in the history entry
- Spoken feedback (TTS)
  - Enable, choose a voice and speed via the System Voice plugin
  - Verify the feedback is limited to transcription readback and does not narrate unrelated UI actions
  - Toggle off and confirm silence
- Per-request STT engine/model selection
  - HTTP API: send `engine`/`model` in the `/v1/transcribe` request and verify the returned metadata
  - CLI: `typewhisper transcribe --engine <id> --model <id>` against a running local server
- Multilingual language hints
  - Open the language picker, search, select multiple languages, verify the selected order and count
  - Reorder the selected languages and confirm hint-aware engines receive the ordered list
  - Confirm engines without language-hint support use the first selected language
- Verify CLI and HTTP API locally
- Upgrade from `1.5.0` with History, Workflows, Dictionary, Snippets, hotkeys, enabled plugins, and update channel preserved

## Before `1.6.0`

- Observe the latest `1.6.0-rc*` build on real machines for multiple days
- No open P0/P1 bugs in the core workflow
- Finalize release notes
- RC and daily tags must not update Homebrew or trigger stable website messaging
- Verify DMG, ZIP, and the `release-candidate` appcast entry with `minimumSystemVersion` set to `14.0`
- Verify Homebrew and the stable appcast update only at the final `1.6.0`
